Hey there, interesting human. I'm Abhinesh, just another computer nerd who loves numbers. Currently, I'm a student in the field of Data Science. I know statistics and sarcasm; these two keep my show running. Now, I want to venture into the world of Big Data (or maybe finance, you never know, because I don't know either ;) ). But hey, for now, I'm lost in the beautiful world of statistics and falling in love with the art of data science. 

I'm a simpleton, and I love my girlfriend (a real human). I'm an enthusiast of everything â€”ask me anything! Maybe I'm the god of averages, (ADHD??????)

that's all folks. Thanks for your patience.
Love you all, machane!
